# BFOR 206 Lab 7-2: Logic & Loops in Python

## Task Description

You can import external libraries into your
Python script. These libraries, sometimes referred to as
modules or packages, contain classes and methods to perform
various tasks.

In this lab, we will use the `os` library to cycle through
a list of files in a directory.

The script should print the names of all files in the
current directory that have a `.py` or `.sh` extension.
Afterwards, it should print the count of files with each
extension.

Name your script logic_loops.py to allow for automatic grading.

# Normal Scenario

## Input
No input.

## Output
**Terminal:** The files in your current directory
with the `.py` or `.sh` extension and the count of 
each type.


# Test Cases

## Case 1: Output
Your output may have many other lines or different
filenames. The key is that only the `.py` and `.sh`
files are shown in the output.

```shell
args_lab.sh is a shell script.
python_intro.py is a python file.
python_basics.py is a python file.
...
There are 2 .py files and 1 .sh files.
```



# Submission instructions

**Scripts that produce unhandled errors will not be accepted!**

Run your script to show that it produces output that
matches the test cases.

When you are finished, show the instructor:
1.  Your code.
2.  Output that looks very
    similar to the output in the test cases.
